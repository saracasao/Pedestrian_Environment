# Framework for Fast Prototyping of Photo-realistic Environments with Multiple Pedestrians

We share a framework built on Unreal Engine and AirSim to easily generate dynamic scenarios with pedestrians. You can download the complete project in [here] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wCmoVsXuwMi-fr58LPKY6x2T8nscM-jX/view?usp=sharing). The project includes: 
- Trajectory plugin with different tools to create custom and random trajectories. 
- Set of pedestrian models ready-to-used by simply dragging and dropping them into the Unreal world. Currently, the project includes 30 pedestrian models, we are working on new models and we will share up to 50.
- Downtown West photo-realistic map that can be found for free download in the Unreal Engine Launcher [weblink] (https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/6bb93c7515e148a1a0a0ec263db67d5b). In order to work with lighter maps, we create two copies: 
  1. Font map (one of the streets has been removed). This map includes a simple example of custom trajectories for two pedestrian models.
  2. Street map (font area has been remove). This map includes a simple example of creating continuous paths.
